## Overview
This project is focused on analyzing the sales data of Apple products across various stores and regions, with the goal of gaining valuable insights into product performance, trends, and customer behavior. By leveraging SQL queries to extract and analyze data, we aim to track key metrics such as the number of units sold, warranty claims, and sales growth over time.

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of Apple's sales performance, identify patterns and trends, and assess the effectiveness of warranty management. The analysis will cover various aspects, including:
- Sales by Region: Understanding the distribution of sales across different countries and states to identify key markets.
- Product Performance: Analyzing the sales trends of individual products over different time periods, such as from launch to 6 months, 6-12 months, and beyond 18 months.
- Warranty Claims Analysis: Investigating warranty claims to assess the quality of products and understand the frequency of claims, including claims marked as "Warranty Void."
- Store Performance: Identifying top-performing stores based on total units sold, as well as analyzing sales trends on a year-by-year basis.
- Sales Growth and Correlation: Analyzing the correlation between product price and warranty claims, as well as tracking the year-on-year growth ratio for each store.

## Key Outcomes
- Insights into Sales Trends: We will gain insights into how Apple products are performing over time, segmented by different periods from launch. This will allow us to identify which products have long-term success and which may need further attention.
- Understanding of Market Segmentation: By analyzing sales data across various countries and states, we will identify which regions are most lucrative and which may need more targeted marketing efforts.
- Warranty Claim Trends: This project will highlight potential issues with products based on warranty claims, and help identify the percentage of claims that result in "Paid Repaired" status, signaling the quality of Appleâ€™s customer support.
- Store and Product Performance: By focusing on the best-selling stores and products, we will uncover the key drivers of sales success and identify areas for improvement.
- Strategic Recommendations: Based on the analysis, recommendations can be made for optimizing product offerings, managing warranty claims more effectively, and focusing on high-performing stores or regions.
This comprehensive analysis will assist Apple in making data-driven decisions for improving product performance, enhancing customer satisfaction, and optimizing sales strategies globally.
